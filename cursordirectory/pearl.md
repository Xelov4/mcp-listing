# Pearl MCP

## Description
The Pearl MCP Server expands the ecosystem of MCP-compatible tools by introducing a distinctive type of tool: humans. Unlike traditional MCP implementations that connect to APIs or code snippets, this server enables AI agents (e.g., Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to interact with domain-specific human experts in real time. It offers a robust path for tasks that require nuanced judgment, contextual understanding, or legal, medical, and technical advice from certified professionals.
