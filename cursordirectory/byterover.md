# BYTEROVER MCP

## Description
Shared memory layer for your AI coding agents - integrated with all major AI IDEs --ByteRover helps create a shared memory layer that captures and indexes all agent interactions, reasoning paths, and developer feedback during coding tasks. Then from those experiences, we creates a memory layer stored in a vector database. Those memories could be retrieved as the AI agents encounter similar contexts to help them find the optimal solution tailored for that specific project/company requirements.
